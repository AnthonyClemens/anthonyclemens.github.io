            <h2>Educational Experience:</h2>
            <p>&emsp;Hello! I am an aspiring graduating from St. Petersburg College in July of 2024 with a bachelor's degree in Technology Development and Management, specializing in software development. I have a passion for technology, which is matched with my solid foundation in computer programming, evidenced by my Advanced Computer Programmer Certificate from St. Petersburg College as well, specializing in Java development.</p>
            <p>&emsp;My technical toolkit is rich and varied. I have developed several Java codebases, crafted a website for a mobile mechanic small business, and have hands-on experience with frameworks like JavaFX, Hibernate, Spring Boot, and Maven. I’m also proficient in SQL, HTML, CSS, and Python, and have a working knowledge of JavaScript and C++.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Beyond programming, my academic journey has equipped me with key industry skills such as project management, agile methodologies, algorithmic design, human-computer interfaces, and an understanding of the legal aspects of managing technology. I’m eager to demonstrate and enhance this blend of programming expertise and management to a forward-thinking company.</p>

            <p>Check out my GitHub for projects I've worked on:</p>
            
            <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyClemens/Billify"><h3>Billify:</h3></a>
            <a href="img/billifypercent.png"><img src="img/billifypercent.png" alt="Billify program screenshot"></a>
            <p>Billify was my first big project that taught me how to use Java Maven, and expand on my existing knowledge of JavaFX. Billify includes expense tracking, allowing users to input and categorize their expenses, which includes their bills, groceries, insurances, entertainment, and savings, etc. Income management will also be included in Billify via the ability to add paychecks, freelancing deposits for things such as Doordash or Instacart, and other forms of income. Another function would be calculating how much money is left after a selectable timeframe, as low as a day, and as large as a year, allowing the user to get a wide range of information on how much money is left over or missing after expenses. In addition to net balance calculation, the end-user can view summaries, charts, and trends all related to their financial activities, giving the user total control over how they can view their expenses and income.</p>

            <a href="img/dmm.png"><img src="img/dmm.png" alt="Debrick Mobile Mechanic Homepage"></a>
            <p>Debrick Mobile is a mobile mechanic shop located in Seffner, FL, of which I was their Software Developer, in which they commissioned a website from me. According to Google Console, the website has over 7,000 impressions. I learned JQuery, Javascript, and enhanced my HTML and CSS skills with this project.</p>

            <a href="https://anthonyclemens.github.io/1227170-Tuning/"><h3>Tuning a '88 Fiero</h3></a>
            <a href="img/fiero.jpg"><img src="img/fiero.jpg" alt="1988 Pontiac Fiero"></a>
            <p>This project was my first official and documented example of solving a problem with different softwares to create a workflow. Other than programming, I really enjoy working on cars. This is my 1988 Pontiac Fiero Formula I saved from South Tampa after it sat rotting for over 20 years. I was having driveability issues and had decided the best way to solve it was to come up with a way to tune it. I had an idea to use an EEPROM instead of the stock EPROM from the 80's, so I found a compatible chip, figured out the wiring to convert it to work with the Fiero ECU, and found a program to write those EEPROM chips with binary files. After scowering the internet, I was able to find a freeware version of GMEPro, an ECU tuning utility, and then a program to combine multiple binary files to let the user switch tune files.</p>
